Presentation Script: Subject-Verb Agreement - Making Sense of the Rules

(Slide 1: Title Slide - "Subject-Verb Agreement: Cracking the Code")

You: "Hello everyone! Today, we're diving into a topic that might seem a bit daunting at first, but it's crucial for clear and effective communication: subject-verb agreement.  Think of it as the grammar glue that holds your sentences together. Now, who here has ever written a sentence and thought, 'Wait, does that sound right?'" (Pause for audience response)

"Exactly! We've all been there. So, let's demystify these rules and make them easy to remember."

(Slide 2: Rule 10 - "There" and "Here" Inversions)

You: "Let's start with a tricky one. When a sentence starts with 'there' or 'here,' where does the subject usually go?" (Pause for audience response)

"That's right, it comes AFTER the verb!  It's like a little grammatical surprise. For example, 'There is a meeting today.' And, 'Here are the results.'  See?  The verb agrees with 'meeting' and 'results', not 'there' or 'here'."

(Slide 3: Rule 11 & 12 - Subjects Joined by "And")

You: "Now, what happens when we join two subjects with 'and'? Usually, it's plural, right?  'The puppy and the lady are friends.' But, here's a twist. If those two subjects refer to one thing, it's singular.  Think, 'Spaghetti and meatballs is my favorite dish.' Or, 'Bread and butter is a classic.'  Anyone have their own example of this?" (Encourage audience participation)

(Slide 4: Rule 13 - Questions)

You: "Questions often flip things around.  The subject isn't always at the beginning. 'Are you going?' 'Has she finished?'  The subject comes after the helping verb.  Simple, right?"

(Slide 5: Rule 14 - Gerunds)

You: "Gerunds, those "-ing" words that act like nouns, are always singular.  'Dancing is a great way to relieve stress.'  Even though you might think of many dance moves, 'dancing' as a whole is one activity."

(Slide 6: Rule 15 - Units of Measurement)

You: "When we talk about units of measurement – time, distance, money – we often treat them as a single unit. 'Three hours has passed.' It's one chunk of time, even if it's multiple hours."

(Slide 7: Rule 16 - "Each," "Every," "No")

You: "These words are powerful. They force the verb to be singular. 'Every house looks the same.' 'Each student has a book.' 'No problem is too big.'  They emphasize the individual, even in a group."

(Slide 8: Rule 17 - Nouns Ending in "-s" but Singular)

You: "Some words are sneaky. 'Mathematics,' 'civics,' 'news' – they look plural, but they're singular subjects. 'Mathematics is my favorite.'  'The news is alarming.'  Remember this one, it's a common mistake."

(Slide 9: Rule 18 - "A Number Of" vs. "The Number Of")

You: "This is a classic. 'A number of people are coming.'  Many people. 'The number of people is 12.'  A specific number.  See the difference?"

(Slide 10: Rule 19 - Always Plural Nouns)

You: "Scissors, pants, tongs – these are always plural. They have two parts!  'Where are my scissors?'  'Those pants fit well.'  Don't be fooled by their appearance."

(Slide 11: Rule 20 - Non-Countable Nouns)

You: "Water, education, information – these are non-countable. They take a singular verb. 'Water is essential.' 'Education is key.'  We're talking about the concept as a whole."

(Slide 12: Interactive Exercise)

You: "Alright, now it's your turn! I'm going to give you a few sentences, and you tell me if the verb is correct. (Show sentences with errors or correct examples).  Let's make it a game!"

(Slide 13: Summary/Q&A)

You: "We've covered a lot of ground today. Remember, subject-verb agreement is all about making sure your verbs match your subjects. Any questions?  Let's discuss!"
